What is Data Structure?
    - different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.

What is an Algorithm?
    - set of instructions to perform a Task.

What makes a good Algorithm?
    - Correctness
    - Efficiency

Why are Data Structures and Algorithms important?
    * Performance Optimization
    * Problem Solving Framework
    * Real-world impact
    * Resource Management
    * Code quality

Types of Data Structure
    - Primitive
        - Integer
        - Float
        - Character
        - Boolean
    - Non Primitive
        - Linear
            - Static
                - Array
            - Dynamic
                - LinkedList
                - Stack
                - Queue
        - Non Linear
            - Tree
            - Graph
    
Types of Algorithms
    * Simple recursive algorithms
        - an algorithm that calls itself recursively
    * Divide and conquer algorithms 
        - divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, and solve this subproblems recursively
        - combine the solutions to the subproblems into a solution to the original problem
            Examples: Quick Sort and Merge Sort
    * Dynamic programming algorithms
        - they word based on memoization
        - to find the best solution
    * Greedy algorithms
        - we take the best we can without worrying about future consequences.
        - we hope that by choosing a local optimum solution at each step, we will end up at a global optimum solution
    * Brute force algorithms
        - It simply tries all the possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found
    * Randomized algorithms
        - use a random number at least once during the computation to make decision
