ARRAYS
    - most used data structure
    - used to store a collection of data
    - simply a collection of objects or things
    - data are located contiguously in the memory
    - can be identified uniquely based on their location (has unique index)
    - the size of the array cannot be changed (the size is predefined)
    - can store data of specified type

Types of Arrays
    * One Dimensional Array
        - an array with bunch of values having been declared with a single index.
    * Multi Dimensional Array
        - Two Dimensional
            - an array with bunch of values having been declared with double index.
        - Three Dimensional
            - an array with bunch of values having been declared with triple index.
        - Four Dimensional
        - N Dimensional

Creating an Array
    When we create an array, we:
        - Declare => creates a reference to array
        - Instantiation of an array => creates an array
        - Initialization => assigns values to cells in array

When to use/avoid Arrays
    When to use
        - to store multiple variables of same data type
        - random access
    When to avoid
        - same data type elements
        - reserve memory
